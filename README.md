Welcome to the Hal9 community repo! This repo contains all the community-contributed scripts that power [hal9.ai](https://hal9.ai). We intend to share profits with creators that contribute to this repo, but we curently don't even have revenue so it's a bit early for that.

Currently, there is no documentation on how to extend the platform; but we have a [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/hal9workspace/shared_invite/zt-sbfsji1z-9hzkyddnTXtjHl5biG32NA) group where we can help you get started.

Please feel free to use our development environment [devel.hal9.ai](https://devel.hal9.ai); however, this environment produces daily builds and is not recommended for production use.
